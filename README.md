Honest Heart Rate

Decided to learn how to do complications so this is a start. Intended for developers, and to
to install it you load it into Android Stuido and run it. Then attach it to a watch face.
Be sure to ALLOW sensor permission - this must be done once it is installed.

There is also an odd glitch upon an install when activate/deactivate calls seems to be a 
bit odd. Simply change to a watch face without the complication and come back. It will work fine
thereafter.

You will notice some times it shows "0". Or on faces with a less-than-ambient mode, the icon 
does not "beat", but once the display comes out of ambient it will. I did compare side by 
side with Samsung's heart rate, and when Samsung's is updating, this one works as well.
When there is "0" or no "beat"; the Samsung complication is showing stale data. Quite frankly
I prefer to know if data is stale.
